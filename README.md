> Nexus dark theme for Mailspring: high contrast black and white theme.

![Mailspring](screenshot.png)

Focus on what matters most. No fancy and splashy colors. It's based on high contrast themes from text editors such as vscode. The code is quick and dirty, it's non modular but it gets the job done. It also disables some icons such as the activity tracker.

## Installation

```
Open Mailspring and install the theme by going to Mailspring > Install New Theme... and selecting the directory.
```

Based on the [Mailspring theme starter](https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring-Theme-Starter), see the [getting started](https://github.com/Foundry376/Mailspring-Theme-Starter#getting-started) guide to modify this theme.
